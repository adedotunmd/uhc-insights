## Introduction
### This is a Power BI project to analyse the Universal Healthcare Coverage globally using the Universal healthcare service coverage index. 

The SDG Target 3.8 is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal Healthcare Coverage Index is a measure of SDG Indicator 3.8.1 while indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household’s budget. The two indicators are usually monitored jointly.

The indicator is an index, ranging from 0 to 100 without any units, calculated as the geometric mean of 14 key indicators of health service coverage. These indicators are grouped into four categories of service coverage: 

1. Reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health
2. Infectious diseases
3. Noncommunicable diseases
4. Service capacity and access

Universal healthcare coverage index is a measure that assesses how well a country provides healthcare to its population.

This Power BI Project will show insights on UHC globally and how the values have changed from 2000 to 2021

## Problem Statement
